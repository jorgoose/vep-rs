description: Close a row of tests/parity/matrix.tsv, moving it from `open` to `landed:<target>` with the tests its target requires. Use when porting an Ensembl VEP flag, plugin, input format or cache field, or when picking up a parity-row issue.

# Close a parity row

A row lands in the pull request that brings its behaviour to its `target`, with the tests the target
requires. [tests/parity/README.md](../../../tests/parity/README.md) defines the columns and the tests
each target needs; read it before step 1. Branching, signing and the pull request follow
[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).

## 1. Read the row

```bash
awk -F'\t' 'NR==1 || $1=="<item>"' tests/parity/matrix.tsv
```

Done when you can state the row's `target`, its `perl_reference` and its `interim` test, if it has one.

## 2. Read the reference

Open the `perl_reference` module and find the code that implements the item. Read it from GitHub at
the pinned tag, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ensembl/ensembl-vep/release/116.2/<path>`, or from
the image with `docker run --rm ensemblorg/ensembl-vep:release_116.2 cat /opt/vep/src/ensembl-vep/<path>`:

| `perl_reference` | `<path>` |
| --- | --- |
| a VEP module (`Config.pm`, `Parser/VCF.pm`) | `modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/VEP/<module>` |
| `vep`, `INSTALL.pl` | the name itself |
| `Variation/<module>` | `Bio/EnsEMBL/Variation/<module>` in the image; in `Ensembl/ensembl-variation` at `modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Variation/<module>`, branch `release/116` |
| a plugin (`<Name>.pm`) | `<Name>.pm` in `Ensembl/VEP_plugins`, branch `release/116` |

Write down the behaviour vep-rs must match, each claim cited as `Module.pm:line`: for an `error` or
`accepted_noop` row, where Ensembl VEP declares the flag and what it does with it; for the other
targets, every behaviour the target covers.

When the Perl source shows the `target` is wrong (an `error` row Ensembl VEP's own behaviour makes an
`accepted_noop`, an `implemented` row that needs the Ensembl database), stop: report a **target
decision** to the maintainers with the citations, and leave the row unchanged.

Done when every claim has a citation you read yourself at `release/116.2`.

## 3. Write Test 1 red

The test lives in the crate the behaviour lives in. Follow the pattern already used for the target:

| `target` | Test 1 | Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `error` | The refusal fires with its message, exit code 1 | `assert_refused` in `crates/vep-cli/tests/cli_errors.rs` |
| `accepted_noop` | Output is byte-identical with and without the flag | `assert_no_effect` in `crates/vep-cli/tests/cli_noops.rs` |
| `removed` | The flag is rejected and `args.rs` no longer declares it | `crates/vep-cli/tests/cli_errors.rs` |
| `implemented` | The effect on a hand-built variant and transcript, the expected value taken from Ensembl VEP's output on the same input and cited | the owning crate's unit tests |
| `documented_subset` | The subset's effect, plus a test that the page states the exclusion | the `implemented` pattern, plus `crates/vep-cli/tests/documented_subsets.rs` |

Done when the test fails for the reason the row describes, and you have seen it fail.

## 4. Make it green

Implement until Test 1 passes.

- **Command-line refusals and no-ops**: a flag refused, or accepted without effect, is an entry of
  `ERROR_TABLE` in `crates/vep-cli/src/config.rs`; its doc comments and the existing entries are the
  contract, and `every_error_table_entry_names_flag_need_and_route` in `cli_errors.rs` checks the
  message's shape. The refusal message, help text and CLI reference all read the entry.
- **Flags**: a flag in Ensembl VEP's `@VEP_PARAMS` is declared in `crates/vep-cli/src/args.rs`; its
  `help_heading` picks the `docs/cli/` page it renders on. After any `args.rs` or error-table change,
  regenerate the CLI reference: `VEP_UPDATE_CLI_REFERENCE=1 cargo test -p vep-cli --test
  cli_reference`.
- **The interim test**: once the real behaviour replaces the stop-gap, delete the test the row's
  `interim` names, and fix every doc comment, module doc or intra-doc link that names it, including
  in tests that belong to other rows.

Done when Test 1 passes and `cargo test -p <crate>` is green.

## 5. Test 2 and Test 3

`implemented` and `documented_subset` rows need a golden corpus that covers the row and a comparison
against Ensembl VEP: follow [corpus.md](corpus.md). Other targets skip this step.

## 6. Land the row

Edit the row:

- `state`: `landed:<target>`.
- `test1`: the tests written for this row, as `<path>.rs::<fn>` separated by `;`.
- `test2`: the corpus, for `implemented` and `documented_subset`; empty for the other targets.
- `interim`: empty.

Find every hand-written page that states the item's old behaviour with `grep -rn -- '<flag or item>'
docs/` and bring it in line; `docs/cli-reference.md` and `docs/cli/` are generated in step 4. A
`documented_subset` exclusion is stated on its page in the sentences Test 1 asserts. Add a
`CHANGELOG.md` entry under Unreleased when the change is visible to a user.

Done when `python3 scripts/parity/check_parity_matrix.py` and `cargo test -p vep-cli --test
parity_matrix` pass.

## 7. Gate

Run the full set in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md#before-pushing), then commit with `-s` and open the
pull request. Done when every command passes and its output is quoted in the pull request's
Verification section.
