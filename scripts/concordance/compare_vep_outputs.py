    clobber an earlier ``1``. The ``unless`` at line 216 then freezes
    ``splice_region`` once any region has set ``start_splice_site`` or

#     on both sides, a signature the generic splice rule does not enforce.
#   * `splice_lastwrite_swap` is the general splice fallback.
#   * `start_cooccurrence_swap` is the strict start co-emission rule.

# Every rule except `covered_splice_region_swap` classifies; that one is the mask

    """What the 116.2 one-sided pass needs from the sorted merge, collected in the one
    read of both key streams.

    ``absent``: the (file, Location) pairs at which vep-rs wrote a structural row and
    the reference wrote nothing: a record the reference dropped as `vep_skip`, since
    116.2 writes at least one row (an intergenic one when nothing is in range) for every
    record it keeps and every route to `vep_skip` is structural; `tandem_repeat` is
    outside the test (`_TANDEM_REPEAT_ALLELE`). Every vep-rs row at an absent Location is
    then set aside whatever its allele, a sequence allele beside the symbolic one of a
    mixed ALT list included, because the reference skips the line whole. This is the
    output-only rule: the ``absent`` test reads no input VCF, and this comparator opens
    one only under `--input-dir` or `--input-vcf`, to recognise gVCF variant sites by
    their shape (``gvcf_sites`` below). The structural-variant comparator reads the input
    and names the record from it (`skipped_record_rows`: the reference's own skip routes
    over the ALT and INFO, confirmed by the reference's absence under the record's own
    Location start and alleles), so a kept record sharing a start or a Location string
    with a skipped one is told apart there. The merge visits keys in sorted order and
    every key of one Location shares the prefix ``Location<TAB>``, so a Location's rows
    from both streams are contiguous and the group closes when the Location changes.

    ``breakends``: for every (file, Location) at which either engine wrote a breakend
    allele, the alleles each side wrote and the mate chromosomes its bracket alleles
    name, for the two breakend classes.

    ``bare_reference_rows``: per (file, Location), the reference-allele rows of a bare
    breakpoint record the unique-tuple key stream dropped, counted on the reference's
    raw output by `count_bare_breakpoint_reference_rows` and handed in through
    `record_bare_reference_rows`, since the merge never sees a duplicate row.

    ``mate_overflow``: the (file, Location) pairs at which the reference wrote a bracket
    allele whose mate position is at least `BND_MATE_32_BIT_LIMIT`, or a Location whose
    start or end is.

    ``reference_only``: the (file, Location) pairs at which the reference wrote and vep-rs
    nothing, under any allele, read by the class that recognises a numified POS from
    the reference's coordinate alone.

    ``gvcf_sites``: the (file, Location) pairs of vep-rs rows at a gVCF variant site, read
    from the input VCF's shape (`gvcf_site_locations_from_vcf`) and from the generated name
    of an ID-less record in vep-rs's output (`gvcf_site_locations`), handed in through
    `record_gvcf_sites`; such a Location the reference wrote nothing for is
    ``gvcf_absent`` rather than ``absent``, whatever its allele.

    """Read discordant.tsv, classify intended-divergence swap pairs, and exclude
    the ones an Ensembl VEP self-contradiction accounts for.

    ``reference_release`` selects the one-sided pass (`REFERENCE_REGISTRIES`); the pair
    rules are the same under both. Under ``"115.2"`` the pass is the scope class below
    and ``record_scope`` is refused; under ``"116.2"`` it is
    `apply_116_2_one_sided_rules` over ``record_scope`` and ``scope_features`` is
    refused, so a caller cannot run one release's reference against the other's class.

    With ``scope_features`` (from ``compare_sorted_key_files``) the one-sided rows of a
    record Perl marks `vep_skip` take the structural-variant comparator's
    transcript-selection class, under its two guards: a vep-rs-only row on a transcript
    Perl did not name is set aside only when Perl named at least one transcript for the
    record and vep-rs named more; a Perl-only row on a transcript vep-rs did not name is
    set aside only when vep-rs named at least as many. A pair on a transcript both
    engines named stays charged, and a record below --max_sv_size with a supported type
    never enters the scope. The class is reported as ``sv_transcript_selection`` in the
    bucket statistics: ``count`` is every one-sided row on a record in scope, ``excluded``
    the rows set aside, ``perl`` and ``rust`` those rows per side.

    Returns ``(excluded_perl_count, excluded_rust_count, bucket_stats)`` where
    ``bucket_stats`` maps each classification bucket to
    ``{"count": pairs classified here, "excluded": how many of those the
    adjusted F1 removes}``. A swap pair is a
    ``(location, allele, feature, feature_type)`` present in BOTH
    ``missing_in_rust`` and ``extra_in_rust`` with different consequence sets.

    With ``open_out`` set, the rows of ``discordant_path`` that no excluding rule
    removed are written there in their original order and layout: both rows of
    every open pair plus every unpaired row. Its row count is therefore the
    adjusted one-sided total, ``(perl - excluded_perl) + (rust - excluded_rust)``.

    CLASSIFICATION AND EXCLUSION ARE SEPARATE, and that separation is the point.
    Every bucket below reports a divergence shape worth naming; only the shapes
    an Ensembl VEP mechanism produces are removed from the denominators. Naming
    a shape and crediting vep-rs for it are separate acts: a counter fused with
    its exclusion would mask every splice-family pair while the cited mechanism
    explains only a fraction of them.

    The buckets, in first-match classification order, are declared in
    ``EXCLUSION_REGISTRY`` above, which also carries each one's exclusion status
    and taxonomy class. Exclusion is driven by the registry's ``excludes`` rules
    evaluated INDEPENDENTLY of that chain, because
    ``_is_covered_splice_region_swap`` is a property of the pair that cuts across
    four buckets rather than lining up with any one of them.

    Every excluding rule's predicate is a subset of some classifying rule's
    predicate, so an excluded pair always lands in a bucket; the assertion after
    the loop is the backstop for that.

    Two filters are deliberately absent from the registry.

    A 3'UTR stop_lost trade-off ("vep-rs emits stop_lost where Perl emits
    3'UTR-only") has no Perl source-line citation behind it: Perl reads the UTR
    sequence from the cache's Bio::EnsEMBL::Slice, and vep-rs does the same
    (``vefc.{three,five}_prime_utr`` in the JSON cache, read by
    ``compute_{three,five}_prime_utr_sequence`` in
    ``crates/vep-effects/src/coding.rs`` with FASTA as the fallback), so
    cache-only mode reaches the Perl-parity verdict and the shape matches no
    tuple.

    An extended start co-emission predicate, one admitting any pair where Perl
    carries a start term vep-rs lacks, absorbs besides the strict shape: pairs
    where vep-rs drops the OTHER start term; pairs where vep-rs misses
    start_lost outright (P=5UTR,start_lost,start_retained / R=5UTR;
    P=frameshift,start_lost / R=frameshift); unrelated
    protein-altering-vs-inframe shapes (P=5UTR,coding_sequence_variant /
    R=5UTR,start_lost); and the inverted shape (P=frameshift,start_retained /
    R=frameshift,start_lost) where Perl emits ONLY start_retained, a separate
    predicate-overlap shape. Leaving those unmasked keeps the vep-rs
    divergences visible and countable. The strict
    ``_is_start_cooccurrence_swap`` is the only start filter, cited to
    Utils/VariationEffect.pm:851-878, :947-963 and :1028-1075 in

# Per-consequence-class F1
#
# Answers "is the aggregate F1 hiding one badly-called consequence class?". The
# quantity that answers it is the FLOOR: the lowest F1 any single Sequence Ontology
# term attains.
#
# It is derived from ARCHIVED artefacts with no engine re-run, which is what makes
# the measurement affordable at all. Three inputs per (dataset, engine):
#
#   * per-term VEP totals, counted over the canonical Perl output's sorted-unique
#     tuple keys -- the same keys the aggregate F1 is scored on;
#   * per-term VEP-only counts, from the run's `discordant.tsv` rows whose `source`
#     is `missing_in_rust`;
#   * per-term engine-only counts, from the same file's `extra_in_rust` rows.
#
# and two derivations:
#
#   intersection_t = VEP_t - VEPonly_t
#   engine_t       = intersection_t + engineonly_t
#
# The first derivation is exact because a tuple is either in the intersection or in
# the VEP-only set, with nothing else to be. The second rests on a property of the
# tuple key: `consequence_set` is one of its five columns, so an intersection tuple
# carries the SAME term set on both sides by construction, and counting term t on
# the VEP side of the intersection counts it on the engine side too. A term-level
# disagreement is never an intersection tuple -- it is a swap PAIR, one row on each
# one-sided list -- so it lands in `VEPonly_t` and `engineonly_t` and never in the
# intersection. That is why the engine's own output is not needed here.
#
# A tuple whose term set holds several terms contributes to each of them, so the
# per-term columns do NOT partition the aggregate and must not be summed back into
# it.

# A per-class F1 over a handful of tuples carries no usable precision (a term
# appearing 3 times with one discordant tuple reads F1 0.67, which is noise, not a
# mis-called class), while at n >= 1,000 a single discordant tuple moves F1 by at
# most 0.001. Terms below it are REPORTED with their counts and excluded from the
# floor only. The threshold is fixed independently of the data: raising it after
# seeing the values would choose the threshold that makes the floor look best.
