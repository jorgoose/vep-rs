# Scripts

Utility scripts for testing, benchmarking, validation, and data preparation.

## Environment

These scripts read their data locations from environment variables, each with a repo-relative default under `./.vep/` so nothing depends on a specific machine layout. Override any of them to point at your own directories, or pass the equivalent `--flag` where a script exposes one. The optional S3 copy is off unless `VEP_BENCHMARK_S3` or `VEP_BENCHMARK_BUCKET` is set.

| Variable                  | Default                 | Used for                                                     |

## Reproducing the published concordance

The published F1 values come from `concordance/run_clone_measurement.sh`, which runs one engine over every benchmark dataset against a populated data tree, not from `run_concordance.sh`. Every published value also re-derives without a run: each raw F1 is `2I/(A+B)` over the tuple counts in `manuscript/data/f1_observations.csv`; the six SNP/indel adjusted values subtract that suite's `masked_pairs` (`manuscript/data/discordance_taxonomy.csv`) from both denominators; the two structural-variant rows carry their own `adj_*` counts ([manuscript/data/README.md](../manuscript/data/README.md)). To re-measure rather than re-derive:

1. **Populate the data tree.** The layout the harness expects under `--data-dir` (each path overridable by the `VEP_*` environment variable named beside its default in the script; there are no path flags):

   ```
   vcf/<asm>/all_variants/<base>.vcf.gz                        SNP/indel downloads (read by --engine perl)
   vcf/<asm>/all_variants_canonical/<base>.canonical.vcf.gz   SNP/indel inputs (read by --engine vep-rs and fastvep)
   ground_truth/perl/snp_indel/<suite>/output.txt             SNP/indel reference output
   ground_truth/perl/sv_per_vcf/canonical_inputs/<asm>/       SV inputs
   ground_truth/perl/sv_per_vcf/<asm>/                        SV reference output, one file per input VCF
   caches/vep-rs/<asm>/                                       vep-rs JSON cache
   caches/fastvep/<asm>.bin                                   fastVEP cache
   caches/perl/vep-cache/                                     Perl Storable cache
   reference/<asm>/genome.fa[.fai]                            reference FASTA
   reference/<asm>/annotation.gff3                            GFF3 annotation
   ```

   `<asm>` is `grch37` or `grch38`; `genome.fa` and `annotation.gff3` are the literal default names, changed only through `VEP_FASTA_GRCH37`/`VEP_FASTA_GRCH38` and `VEP_GFF3_GRCH37`/`VEP_GFF3_GRCH38`. The raw inputs come from `data/download_real_world_vcfs.sh` and the 13 synthetic SV files from `tests/sv_validation/<asm>/`. `all_variants/` is the download script's tree: `--engine perl` reads `all_variants/<base>.vcf.gz` and derives a canonical copy per run with `bcftools`. `all_variants_canonical/` holds the staged `<base>.canonical.vcf.gz` files that `--engine vep-rs`, `--engine fastvep` and `generate_reference_output.sh` (step 2) read; the harness does not derive them, so stage them before either runs. `<base>` is the `vcf_base` column of the suite table in the script.

   "Canonical" means Ensembl-style contig names (`21`, not `chr21`) on the canonical contigs only (`1`-`22`, `X`, `Y`, `MT`, `M`): raw GRCh38 chr21 inputs score F1 = 0 against a reference that names contigs the Ensembl way, so canonicalise every input symmetrically. A staged file is derived from its download the way the harness's own `canonicalize` function derives the Perl copy: strip a `chr` prefix from the records and the `##contig` lines, then `bcftools view -G -t 1,2,...,22,X,Y,MT,M -O z` and `tabix -p vcf`. (`concordance/prepare_benchmark_vcfs.py --canonical-contigs` applies the same contig rule to a directory of inputs; it does not drop genotypes.) `-G` drops per-sample genotypes, which change no consequence: VEP annotates per position and allele, and the tab output carries no genotype column. It is a no-op on the four ClinVar and gnomAD downloads, which are sites-only at source, and it is what the two 1000 Genomes timed cells need, because their downloads (`1kg_integrated_chr21.vcf.gz`, `1kg_highcov_chr21.vcf.gz`) carry genotypes. The suite table names four canonical 1000 Genomes files, two of them under names the download script does not write:

   | `<base>`                         | Assembly | Derived from                  | Genotypes | Measures                                                                              |
   | -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `1kg_integrated_chr21_sitesonly` | GRCh37   | `1kg_integrated_chr21.vcf.gz` | dropped   | the published F1 and wall-time cell                                                   |
   | `1kg_integrated_chr21`           | GRCh37   | `1kg_integrated_chr21.vcf.gz` | kept      | the sample-scaling wall time (`1kg_integrated_chr21_multisample` in `wall_times.csv`) |
   | `1kg_highcov_chr21`              | GRCh38   | `1kg_highcov_chr21.vcf.gz`    | dropped   | the published F1 and wall-time cell                                                   |
   | `1kg_highcov_chr21_multisample`  | GRCh38   | `1kg_highcov_chr21.vcf.gz`    | kept      | the sample-scaling wall time                                                          |

   The genotype-keeping copies take the same contig filter without `-G`. Because `--engine perl` reads `all_variants/<base>.vcf.gz`, that tree needs a `1kg_integrated_chr21_sitesonly.vcf.gz` (a `bcftools view -G` copy of the download) beside the downloads; the Perl branch drops genotypes on every input it canonicalises, so it never times a genotype-carrying form. The sample-scaling rows run only when named in `--suites` and are wall-time cells only: no reference output exists for them, their consequence output is that of the sites-only form, and the released rows for them are `vep-rs` and `fastvep`.

2. **Generate the reference output.** `concordance/generate_reference_output.sh` runs Perl VEP (`ensemblorg/ensembl-vep:release_116.2` with cache version 116 by default; `--perl-image` and `--cache-version` override) over the canonical inputs and writes the SNP/indel reference output per suite and the structural-variant reference output per input VCF into the `ground_truth/` layout above, passing `--fasta` at every call site; each of the 16 structural-variant VCFs per assembly is annotated in its own invocation, so no file's transcript-cache population can affect another's. The published values were scored against reference output at cache version 115, except ClinVar GRCh37, whose reference is the cache 113 set that a cache 115 regeneration reproduces key for key (`docs/concordance-provenance/2026-09-18-grch37-cache-113-vs-115.json`).

3. **Convert the cache both engines read.** vep-rs annotates from a JSON conversion of the Storable cache Perl VEP read (`data/storable_to_json.pl`, usage below), which holds the transcript set fixed across the two engines. `concordance/cache_parity_audit.pl` audits the conversion: it reads a seeded sample of transcripts from both caches and classifies every Storable field against the converter's rules (identical, renamed, converted, dropped because undefined, dropped by a named rule, or an unexplained gap). Its manifest for the GRCh37 pair, the cache-version-113 Storable VEP release 115 ships for that assembly and its JSON conversion, is `docs/concordance-provenance/2026-09-16-cache-parity-audit.json` (the manifest names neither release nor assembly; its `json_transcripts_indexed` of 195,232 is the GRCh37 cache's transcript count). Every field vep-rs reads for consequence calling is carried. Two Storable fields are absent from the JSON side under no rule (`_gene_version`, which the converter maps and the published cache lacks, and `_uniprot_isoform`, unmapped), and vep-rs reads neither. The SIFT and PolyPhen prediction matrices are dropped by a named rule: the converter reads a `predictions_data` field that only the native cache builder writes, and the concordance tuple carries no prediction field, so this enters no published F1. The translation's sequence edits, the `Bio::EnsEMBL::SeqEdit` list VEP applies to the reference allele's peptide at annotation time, are carried as `variation_effect_feature_cache.seq_edits`, one object per edit (`code`, `name`, `start`, `end`, `alt_seq`, `length_diff`; always an array, `[]` when the translation has none), and vep-rs applies them as VEP does. The cached peptide cannot stand in for them: the release 115 Storable caches store `M` as the first residue over any start codon of the codon table whether or not an `initial_met` edit exists. The audit's named rule for that field applies only to a cache converted without it; on such a cache vep-rs applies no edit, and a variant at codon 1 of a transcript with an alternative initiation codon is called from the cached peptide. The manifest above records the published GRCh37 conversion, which carries no `seq_edits`.

4. **Run the measurement.**

   ```bash
   scripts/concordance/run_clone_measurement.sh \
     --engine vep-rs --vep-binary target/release/vep \
     --data-dir /path/to/data --output-dir /path/to/data/work
   ```

   Each SNP/indel suite is scored by `concordance/compare_vep_outputs.py` and each structural-variant set by `validation/compare_sv_concordance.py`; the per-suite `report/` directories carry the raw and adjusted tuple counts, and `wall_times.csv` the timing. The published cells ran with `--fork 16` on 32-vCPU hosts (the host specification is recorded in `docs/concordance-provenance/2026-09-20-n20-parallel-clones.json`); `--fork` is overridable and F1 does not depend on it, which `crates/vep-cli/src/runner.rs` gates with a fork-1-versus-fork-4 equality test.

F1 is deterministic per binary and architecture-independent: a re-run on the same binary, cache, reference FASTA, canonical inputs and reference output reproduces the committed tuple counts exactly, and any difference points at one of those inputs rather than at the machine.

#### storable_to_json.pl Usage

Converts Perl VEP Storable cache files to the JSON format expected by `json_cache.rs`. This is a **testing tool** for concordance validation: it produces a cache derived from the exact same transcript data Perl VEP uses, eliminating transcript set differences.

The script takes positional arguments only: `cache_dir output_dir [chr1,chr2,...]`, with the
optional chromosome list as ONE comma-separated argument. It lives at `scripts/data/`, so
mount that directory into the container.

```bash
# Convert specific chromosomes (one comma-separated list)
docker run --rm -v /path/to/cache:/input:ro -v /output/dir:/output \
  -v $(pwd)/scripts/data:/scripts:ro \
  ensemblorg/ensembl-vep:release_116.2 \
  perl /scripts/storable_to_json.pl /input /output 21,22

# Convert all chromosomes
docker run --rm -v /path/to/cache:/input:ro -v /output/dir:/output \
  -v $(pwd)/scripts/data:/scripts:ro \
  ensemblorg/ensembl-vep:release_116.2 \
  perl /scripts/storable_to_json.pl /input /output
```

To inspect a Storable object's raw structure, use Perl's `Data::Dumper` inside the same
container; the converter has no dump mode.

Output: `{output}/transcripts/{chr}/{start}-{end}.json` + `{output}/info.json`. Each
transcript's `variation_effect_feature_cache` carries `seq_edits`, the translation's
`Bio::EnsEMBL::SeqEdit` list (`code`, `name`, `start`, `end`, `alt_seq`, `length_diff`, protein
coordinates; `[]` when there are none), which vep-rs applies to the reference peptide. A cache
without a `seq_edits` key (the published conversions among them) loads; vep-rs applies no edit
and reads the reference peptide as cached, so convert again to get VEP's calls at alternative
initiation codons.
