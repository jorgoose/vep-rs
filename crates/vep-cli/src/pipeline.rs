//! The three-stage pipeline behind `Runner::run`.
//!
//! A reader thread turns the input into batches, the coordinator (the calling
//! thread) has each batch parsed, annotated and rendered on the rayon pool, and
//! a writer thread puts the rendered bytes on the output in input order. The
//! reader hands its batches over a bounded channel of the pipeline depth
//! ([`PIPELINE_DEPTH`] unless `--pipeline_depth` says otherwise), so it runs at
//! most that many batches ahead of the coordinator; the channel to the writer
//! holds that many whole batches in batched mode and one chunk per pool thread
//! in streaming mode, where the permits below bound the batches in flight, so
//! the memory the pipeline holds is a fixed number of batches either way. The
//! reader's line buffers travel back to it on a return channel and are reused;
//! the coordinator keeps its own vectors from batch to batch.
//!
//! The coordinator runs in one of two modes (`--pipeline_mode`). Streaming, the
//! default: the coordinator warms the chromosomes a batch names and hands it
//! to the pool as independent tasks, each annotating, rendering and freeing its
//! own records (and parsing them first, for a VCF input; the other formats are
//! parsed on the reader thread) and sending its chunk to the writer, then takes
//! the next batch at once; the writer reorders the chunks by batch and chunk
//! index, and a permit per batch, returned by the writer once the batch's last
//! chunk is queued for writing, keeps the batches in flight within the pipeline
//! depth. A task's skip warnings, and the warnings its records draw, travel with
//! its chunk and the writer reports them as it reaches the chunk, so the warnings
//! file and the skipped-variants file list them in input order in both modes.
//! Batched: each batch is parsed on the pool, its chromosomes warmed, then
//! annotated and rendered on the pool, one pass after another, and sent whole. A
//! run with plugins, or one reading known variants from the cache's variation
//! files or from the `--check_svs` file, is batched whatever the mode: plugins
//! see a whole batch at once, and each of those sources prefetches one batch's
//! regions at a time.
//!
//! Errors: each stage returns the first error it meets; a stage whose peer has
//! hung up returns `Ok`, so the stage that failed is the only one reporting.
//! A streaming task's error travels to the writer in place of its chunk, so
//! the error reported is the first in input order and every chunk before it
//! reaches the output (the batched coordinator stops at the failing batch, so
//! the two modes' partial output on a failed run can differ within that batch).
//! [`run`] reports the reader's error before the coordinator's before the
//! writer's.
