//! CLI argument parsing for VEP using clap 4 derive API.
//!
//! All flags and aliases match the Ensembl VEP CLI interface so that users
//! can switch between implementations with minimal changes. Ensembl VEP
//! uses underscores in flag names (e.g., `--input_file`, `--dir_cache`),
//! so every underscore-containing flag has an explicit `long = "..."`.
//!
//! A flag the error table of [`crate::config`] governs (refused, or accepted
//! without effect) carries no help text here: [`Args::command_with_error_table`]
//! applies the table's, so `--help` and the generated CLI reference read one
//! source. Every flag lives under a help heading, the section of the reference
//! it is documented in.
//!
//! The command line reaches this parser through [`crate::argv::prepass`], which
//! adds the flags of the `--config` file, `vep.ini` and the `VEP_*` variables
//! and spells single-dash and other-case long options as declared here; a
//! unique prefix of a long name is accepted here as well (`infer_long_args`),
//! as Getopt::Long's `auto_abbrev` accepts it.
