# vep-cli

The command line of vep-rs: the `vep` binary, a drop-in for the Ensembl Variant Effect
Predictor (VEP) command line, and the `vep_cli` library behind it. The crate's two binaries
(`vep` and `bench_plugins`) call the library, `vep-cache-converter` lists it as a dependency,
and a program that embeds annotation holds its `Annotator` across many batches. It reads
variants in Variant Call Format (VCF) or VEP's other input formats, annotates them against a
JSON transcript cache, and writes VEP's default, tab, VCF, JSON or Parquet output through the
`vep-io` formatters.

## How it works

Follow one VCF record. `main.rs` parses the command line into `Args`; `Config::from_parsed`
resolves the defaults, the fields `--everything` and `--vcf` imply, and the automatic thread
counts; `Runner::run` refuses to overwrite an existing output without `--force_overwrite`,
builds a rayon thread pool of `--fork` workers, opens the indexed FASTA (the reference
genome's sequence file) when `--fasta` names one, loads each `--plugin` argument as a built-in
from `vep-builtins` or, when no built-in claims the name, as a C-ABI (application binary
interface) dynamic library through `vep-plugin`, enumerates the cache's `transcripts/<chr>/`
shards into a `LazyTranscriptIndexes` that parses a chromosome the first time a variant asks
for it, and opens the cache's variation files (`variations/<chr>/all_vars.gz`, one per
chromosome and read through its index, or `<start>-<end>_var.gz` region files parsed whole)
only when `--check_existing`, or a flag that implies it such as `--af` or `--pubmed`, needs
them, or when `--format id` resolves its identifiers through them. The run then proceeds as
three stages joined by bounded channels. The reader
thread scans the input line by line: a `#` line is held for the VCF writer's header block, a
data line is appended to the current `LineBatch` with its line number, and the first record of
a new chromosome asks a helper thread to warm that chromosome's transcript index and the next
one in the input's tabix contig order. The coordinator, the calling thread, has the batch's
lines parsed on the pool, by its streaming tasks or as one pass of the batched mode (both
below): `parse_data_line` reads the record once (its columns, its `INFO` view and its
tandem-repeat warnings), routes it through `vep-core`'s structural-variant rules (a
`<CNV:TR>` record expanded to explicit alleles when a FASTA is given) and splits a sequence
record into one `InputVariant` per alternate allele, alleles trimmed, a bi-allelic record's
from both ends under `--minimal`; the record then passes the checks of `validate`, its
deletion test reading the record's parsed `INFO` (the view, or a copy of the column for a
line that is not UTF-8), after which `split_minimal_record` trims each allele of a
multi-allelic record under `--minimal`. Under `--check_frequency` the coordinator
co-locates the batch first and `frequency_filter` drops each allele and record that the
population's frequencies rule out, as Ensembl VEP's variation source filters its buffer
before any transcript is read. Each remaining variant then passes through `annotate_one`:
`annotate_variant` visits every transcript overlapping the variant's span and calls
`vep_effects::calculate_consequences` on each, a single-residue substitution gains its SIFT (Sorting
Intolerant From Tolerant) and PolyPhen (Polymorphism Phenotyping) predictions, a breakend
gains its mate's consequences, `variation_matcher` attaches the co-located known variants,
`sv_source` the known structural variants of `--check_svs`, and a variant on a cached
chromosome that overlaps nothing becomes `intergenic_variant`. Built-in
plugins see the whole batch in one `run_batch` call and dynamic-library plugins run per
consequence; `pick::apply_to_batch` applies the pick flags and summaries to each record's
alleles together; `render_record` hands each record's alleles to the chosen `vep-io` formatter
(the tab format's byte path, `render_tab_record`, included), or to
`render_default_record` for VEP's default text format. Without plugins or a known-variant
source the coordinator streams: it warms the chromosomes a batch names and hands the batch to the
pool as independent tasks that each annotate, filter, render and free their own records (and
parse them first, for a VCF input; the other formats are parsed on the reader thread),
then takes the next batch without waiting for them; with plugins, or with the cache's variation
files or the `--check_svs` file open, each batch crosses the pool whole, one pass after another
(`--pipeline_mode batched` asks for that path on any run). The writer thread puts the rendered
chunks back in input order and writes them to the output; a Parquet run writes a TSV
(tab-separated values) intermediate and converts it with a DuckDB subprocess once the pipeline
has drained.

## Modules

| Module                      | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/main.rs`               | The `vep` binary: parses `Args`, sets the log level from `--verbose` and `--quiet`, prints the version banner, builds `Config`, answers `--resolved_config` before any cache opens, and runs `Runner`; mimalloc is the global allocator under the default `mimalloc` feature |
| `src/lib.rs`                | The library root: re-exports the embedding surface (`Annotator`, `Config`, `apply_to_record`, the transcript index types, `InputVariant`, `JsonOutputFormatter`) and declares the modules                                      |
| `src/args.rs`               | The clap definition of every flag, named as Ensembl VEP names them (underscores included); a flag the error table of `config.rs` governs takes its help text from that table                                                                  |
| `src/argv.rs`               | The command line before clap reads it: `prepass` lays the flags of the `--config` file, `<dir>/vep.ini` and the `VEP_<FLAG>` environment variables out around the command line in Ensembl VEP's priority (`Config.pm:693-698`), and resolves Ensembl VEP's option spellings against the clap definition |
| `src/config.rs`             | `Config::from_parsed`: the error table of refused and no-effect flags, the fields the option sets imply, the `--fork` and `--decompression_threads` automatic caps, `--distance`, tilde expansion and the cache path the output header prints                       |
| `src/option_rules.rs`       | Ensembl VEP's option rules as data (`Config.pm:327-645`): the lists, option sets, valid values, requirements, incompatibilities and deprecations, and the flag state they are applied to and checked on |
| `src/cache_resolve.rs`      | `resolve`: the cache directory from `--json_cache`, else from `--dir_cache`, `--species`, `--refseq`/`--merged`, `--cache_version` and `--assembly` in Ensembl VEP's layout; requires `transcripts/` and `info.json` and an assembly that agrees with the cache, and picks up an indexed FASTA inside it unless `--fasta` or `--no_fasta` is given |
| `src/runner.rs`             | `Runner::run`: opens input and output, loads FASTA, plugins, transcripts and variations, picks the output formatter, drives the pipeline and finalizes Parquet; owns `annotate_one`, `annotate_batch` and `annotate_variant` |
| `src/input_shape.rs`        | `InputShape`: whether the input is an indexed BGZF file and, from four index-resolved windows of blocks, how many bytes its records inflate to and how many it holds, the signals `--decompression_threads auto` and `--resolved_config` read |
| `src/pipeline.rs`           | The three-stage pipeline: reader thread, coordinator (streaming by default, batched on request or when plugins or a known-variant source are in play) and writer thread over bounded channels, the resolution of each input chromosome name to the cache's through the synonym table, the chromosome prewarmer, the fused annotate-render pass and the output sink behind `--writer_strategy` |
| `src/warnings.rs`           | The warning `Sink`: every `warn!` event and skipped-variant report, written once per text to the warnings file (`--warning_file`, default `<output_file>_warnings.txt`) and echoed on standard error unless `--quiet`; the `--skipped_variants_file` written when the run ends |
| `src/render.rs`             | `render_record` and `render_default_record`: one input record's rows, through the chosen `vep-io` formatter (the tab byte path included) or as VEP's default text format, appended to a render task's output bytes                                        |
| `src/output_compress.rs`    | `OutputCompression`: `--compress_output` gzip or bgzip encoding of the output in process, in place of the `gzip -c` or `bgzip -c` pipe Ensembl VEP opens; `CompressedOutput::finish` writes the stream's trailer once every line is written |
| `src/annotator.rs`          | The embedding entry point: `Annotator` over `AnnotationResources` and a scoped pool, the `RawRow` simple-allele input, the per-row `AnnotationError`, and the shared loaders for FASTA, plugins and transcripts            |
| `src/json_cache.rs`         | Deserializes the JSON cache: enumerates `transcripts/<chr>/<start>-<end>.json` shards and loads one chromosome's transcripts                                                                                                 |
| `src/regulatory.rs`         | `RegulatorySource`: the cache's regulatory and motif features under `regulatory/<chr>/`, one chromosome's shards parsed on first use into a start-sorted index, and `annotate`, which adds a record's `RegulatoryFeature` and `MotifFeature` rows with their terms and motif fields |
| `src/variation_source.rs`   | `VariationSource`: the cache's variation files under `variations/<chr>/`, opened on first use and read through their index for the records a variant's window reaches, with a per-batch prefetch                           |
| `src/variation_name_index.rs` | `resolve_names`: the `--format id` pass over the cache's variation files, every name of the list held in memory and every file read once, each name mapped to its variation features                                   |
| `src/transcript_lookup.rs`  | `TranscriptLookup`: the stable-id, translation-id and gene-name index over the run's transcript cache behind HGVS `c.`, `n.` and `p.` input, built on the first lookup from the reference sequences' shards and extended to the alternate loci, patches and LRG regions only when a stable id is found on none of them |
| `src/transcript_index.rs`   | The per-chromosome transcript interval index (UCSC binning), each chromosome's protein-coding transcription start sites beside it; `LazyTranscriptIndexes` loads each chromosome once; `MaterializedTranscriptIndexes` proves every chromosome loaded |
| `src/nearest.rs`            | `--nearest`: the protein-coding transcription start sites nearest a record, found as Ensembl VEP's `TranscriptTree::nearest` finds them over the chromosome's site table, and the identifiers reported for them                                                                                   |
| `src/vcf_parser.rs`         | Parses one VCF data line into `InputVariant`s: the fixed fields, allele trimming and minimisation per alternate allele, structural records through `vep-core`'s routing, the `--max_sv_size` limit                          |
| `src/validate.rs`           | Ensembl VEP's record validation, `validate_vf` (`Parser.pm:457-649`), over the alleles parsed from one input record: the `--chr` list, the coordinates, the `--max_sv_size` bound, the chromosome against the cache, the allele string, an insertion's coordinates, the reference allele's length, then `--check_ref` or `--lookup_ref`; a failing record is reported through the warning sink and dropped, or kept under `--dont_skip` |
| `src/individuals.rs`        | The per-individual readings of a VCF record: under `--individual` each named sample's genotype, read from the record's sample columns, becomes a copy with its own allele string and zygosity; under `--individual_zyg` the record stays one feature whose `ZYG` list carries every named sample's zygosity; and the reference-allele row of `--process_ref_homs` |
| `src/frequency_filter.rs`   | `FrequencyFilter`: the `--check_frequency` stage (`--freq_pop`, `--freq_freq`, `--freq_gt_lt`, `--freq_filter`, `--filter_common`), Ensembl VEP's population check, frequency lookup with the strand, remainder and matched-allele rules, the include and exclude verdicts, the `FREQS` entries and the rewritten allele string of a record that lost alleles |
| `src/variation_matcher.rs`  | Matches input variants to the known variants of their window as Ensembl VEP does (by allele after trimming from either end, strand-aware, span-only for null alleles and under `--no_check_alleles`, `--failed` applied), and writes the Extra column fields (IMPACT, STRAND, the frequency and clinical fields, plugin keys) |
| `src/sv_source.rs`          | `SvSource`: Ensembl's structural-variant VCF of `--check_svs <file>`, read through its index for the top-level records overlapping each variant, with a per-batch prefetch; the names fill `SV` and the JSON `colocated_structural_variants`                                                                                  |
| `src/pick.rs`               | `FilterConfig`, `apply_to_record` and `apply_to_batch`: the record-level steps over an input record, the row filters of `src/row_filter.rs` first, then VEP's pick algorithm and summaries for `--pick`, `--per_gene`, `--pick_order`, `--most_severe`, `--summary` and the `--flag_pick` variants |
| `src/row_filter.rs`         | `RowFilters` and `affects_cds`: the `--no_intergenic` and `--coding_only` row filters, applied to each input record before the pick family as Ensembl VEP applies them |
| `src/filter_set.rs`         | `FilterSet`: Ensembl VEP's filter grammar (`field operator value` units joined by `and` and `or`, grouped by parentheses and inverted by `not`), compiled from `--transcript_filter` over the cache's transcript keys and evaluated on each overlapping transcript before its consequences are calculated |
| `src/dylib_plugins.rs`      | Loads the `--plugin` names no built-in claimed as C-ABI dynamic libraries and runs them over a batch, merging their JSON results into each consequence's `plugin_data`                                                        |
| `src/bin/bench_plugins.rs`  | The `bench_plugins` binary: times the phases of an annotation run with and without plugins and writes a JSON report                                                                                                          |

## Command line

`vep` has no subcommands: one invocation annotates one input. The flags are Ensembl VEP's,
underscores included, so an existing VEP command line parses; a flag the help marks "accepted
for VEP compatibility" parses and changes no annotation (the cache flags among them only name
the cache path the output header prints). The groups below name the flags that shape a run;
the full list, with every flag's parity note, is
[docs/cli-reference.md](../../docs/cli-reference.md).

| Group     | Flags                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input     | `-i`/`--input_file` (default `STDIN`, in any case; a gzip or BGZF file is decompressed whatever its name) or `--input_data`/`--id`, the records as a string; `--format` vcf, ensembl, hgvs, region, id (a list of variant identifiers, resolved from the cache's variation files), or `guess`, which reads the first data line as Ensembl VEP does and which standard input cannot use                                                                                                                                   |
| Output    | `-o`/`--output_file` (default `variant_effect_output.txt`, `STDOUT` for standard output); `--output_format` vep, vcf, json, tab or parquet, with `--vcf`, `--json` and `--tab` as shorthands; `--force_overwrite`; `--no_headers`; `--vcf_info_field` (default `CSQ`) |
| Cache     | `--dir_cache` (else `--dir`), `--species`, `--cache_version`, `--refseq` and `--merged` select the cache in Ensembl VEP's `<dir_cache>/<species>/<version>_<assembly>` layout; `--json_cache <dir>` (alias `--full_cache_dir`) names the directory itself; `--show_cache_info` prints its source versions; `--no_fasta` ignores a FASTA inside it; `--synonyms <file>` replaces the cache's `chr_synonyms.txt`, through which an input chromosome name reaches the cache's |
| Reference | `--fasta`/`--fa`, an indexed FASTA; `--hgvs`, `--hgvsg` and `--shift_3prime 1`, which require it; `--assembly`, read by the assembly-sensitive plugins                                                                                                                              |
| Runtime   | `--fork`/`--threads` (0 = every logical CPU up to 32); `--decompression_threads` (0 = up to 10, for BGZF input; `auto` reads an indexed BGZF input's record width); `--buffer_size` (default 5000 variants per batch); `--max_sv_size` (-1 lifts the limit)                                                   |
| Fields    | `--everything` and the field flags it implies: `--symbol`, `--canonical`, `--mane`, `--hgvs`, `--sift`, `--polyphen`, `--numbers`, `--domains`, `--variant_class`, `--af`, `--af_1kg`, `--af_gnomade`, `--af_gnomadg`, `--max_af`, `--pubmed`, `--check_existing` and the rest |
| Picking   | `--pick`, `--pick_allele`, `--per_gene`, `--pick_allele_gene`, `--most_severe`, `--summary`, `--flag_pick`, `--flag_pick_allele`, `--flag_pick_allele_gene`                                                                                                 |
| Plugins   | `--plugin Name,key=value,...`, repeatable; `--dir_plugins`, where dynamic-library plugins are found                                                                                                                                                         |
| Parsing   | `--dont_skip` keeps a record that fails a check; `--allow_non_variant` keeps reference-only VCF records in every output format; `--chr`, `--check_ref` and `--lookup_ref` filter and check records as Ensembl VEP does                                 |
| Verbosity | `-v`/`--verbose` (debug logging); `-q`/`--quiet` (errors only, no progress line)                                                                                                                                                                           |

Three declared flags are refused with an error rather than ignored, because the feature they
belong to is not implemented: `--regulatory_gff`, `--extended_promoters` and
`--custom_suppress_filter`. `--regulatory` annotates the regulatory and motif features of a cache
converted with them, and warns once when the cache holds none.

```bash
vep -i input.vcf -o output.txt --json_cache /path/to/json_cache --offline --everything
```

`bench_plugins`, the crate's second binary, takes `--input`, `--json-cache`, repeated `--plugin`
arguments in the `vep --plugin` format, `--variants`, `--runs` and `--output-json`, and reports
per-phase timings as JSON.

## Public API

The re-exports in `lib.rs` are the embedding surface; the submodules stay `pub` for the in-tree
binaries and tests, and their contents may move between releases.

## Run it

```bash
cargo build -p vep-cli                     # target/debug/vep and target/debug/bench_plugins
cargo test -p vep-cli                      # unit tests plus the integration suites under tests/
cargo run -p vep-cli --bin vep -- --help   # the full flag list
```

`cargo build -p vep-cli --no-default-features --bin vep` builds `vep` on the system allocator
instead of mimalloc. Each integration suite under `tests/` covers one contract:
`integration_test.rs` runs the built binary as a subprocess; `golden.rs` and `format_parity.rs`
compare every output format on the golden corpora with the Ensembl VEP files committed beside
them; `pipeline_parity.rs` checks that the output bytes do not change with the batch size, the
thread count, the pipeline mode, depth and task size or the writer strategy; `parity_matrix.rs`
checks that every long flag has a row in
`tests/parity/matrix.tsv` at the repository root; `dylib_plugins.rs` exercises the
dynamic-library plugin path. `cargo bench -p vep-cli --bench cache_load_bench` times cache
loading and skips itself when `$VEP_JSON_CACHE_DIR` names no cache. The repository's standard
commands (the workspace test run, clippy, fmt, the release build) are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
