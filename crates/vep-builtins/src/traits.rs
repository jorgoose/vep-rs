//! Plugin trait definition for built-in VEP plugins.
//!
//! Built-in plugins operate on native Rust types without JSON serialization
//! or C FFI overhead. The plugin execution model has three layers:
//!
//! - [`prefetch`](BuiltinPlugin::prefetch) + [`annotate`](BuiltinPlugin::annotate):
//!   Two-phase execution that separates I/O (parallelizable) from annotation
//!   (sequential). Tabix plugins implement these to enable parallel prefetch
//!   across independent data files.
//! - [`run_batch`](BuiltinPlugin::run_batch): Single-phase fallback for plugins
//!   that don't benefit from parallel I/O (e.g., in-memory lookups).
//! - [`run`](BuiltinPlugin::run): Per-transcript-consequence annotation for
//!   simple per-transcript plugins.

/// Trait that all built-in VEP plugins implement.
///
/// Plugins are compiled directly into the binary and operate on native Rust
/// types. There are three execution strategies (the registry picks the best
/// one automatically):
///
/// 1. **Two-phase (prefetch + annotate):** The registry calls [`prefetch`]
///    on all plugins in parallel (via rayon), then calls [`annotate`]
///    sequentially to write results into variants. Tabix plugins use this
///    to overlap I/O from independent data files.
///
/// 2. **Single-phase (run_batch):** Fallback for plugins that return `None`
///    from [`prefetch`]. Called sequentially with `&mut` access to variants.
///
/// 3. **Per-transcript (run):** Default implementation of [`run_batch`]
///    dispatches to [`run`] for each transcript consequence.
///
/// [`prefetch`]: BuiltinPlugin::prefetch
/// [`annotate`]: BuiltinPlugin::annotate
/// [`run_batch`]: BuiltinPlugin::run_batch
/// [`run`]: BuiltinPlugin::run

    ///
    /// Default is a no-op. Plugins that need it fall into two groups:
    ///
    /// - **Dual-coordinate files**: REVEL ships one file holding both
    ///   `hg19_pos` and `grch38_pos`, indexed on a different column per
    ///   assembly. Without the assembly the plugin cannot know which column
    ///   holds the coordinates tabix indexed, and reads the wrong one.
    /// - **Per-assembly bundles**: LoFTEE's upstream GERP data is a tabix TSV
    ///   on GRCh37 and a bigWig on GRCh38, with different END_TRUNC cutoffs.
    ///
    /// Plugins keyed on gene symbol (LoFtool, pLI) genuinely ignore this: one file
    /// serves both assemblies.
    ///
    /// Several plugins whose databases are pre-split per assembly override it, to
    /// *validate* that the supplied file matches the requested build rather than
    /// annotating from the wrong genome. A pre-split file is not self-evidently
    /// correct: the two copies share a column layout, so pointing a run at the wrong
    /// one resolves contigs, matches nothing, and exits 0. Each uses whichever
    /// in-file signal that database carries: CADD a `##`-preamble marker
    /// ([`tabix::detect_assembly_marker`](crate::tabix::detect_assembly_marker)),
    /// dbscSNV its coordinate column names, AlphaMissense its per-row `genome`
    /// column ([`tabix::first_data_row_field`](crate::tabix::first_data_row_field)).
    ///
    /// gnomADc deliberately does not: its two files are different
    /// releases (v2.1 genomes on GRCh37, v4.0 exomes on GRCh38) whose headers the
    /// plugin already reads to discover its output fields, and neither carries a
